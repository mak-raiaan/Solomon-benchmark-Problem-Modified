# Solomon Benchmark Problem Modified Dataset

## Research Purpose
For our research, we have utilized three dataset files from the Solomon benchmark Problem. The Solomon benchmark Problem is a well-known benchmark in the field of vehicle routing and scheduling, providing datasets for testing and evaluating algorithms. Our research focuses on optimizing the delivery process using drones, specifically the "Wingcopter 198" drone.

## Dataset Parameters
We have included two essential parameters in our dataset: "Weight" and "Delivery Deadline."

### Weight
The "Weight" column signifies the weight of the products scheduled for delivery, and it falls within the range of 0.3kg to 4.5kg. This range is chosen based on the weight constraints of our drone, "Wingcopter 198," which has a maximum carrying capacity of 5kg.

### Delivery Deadline
The "Delivery Deadline" represents the time window assigned for the delivery of each product. Our choice is based on operational experiments and a careful analysis of industry standards. Notably, we observed that parcels delivered by drones on popular e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart usually fall within this weight range, and the time limit is within the specified window.

## Solomon Benchmark Paper
